BIOL5393M Research Project module write up guidelines. 
The   project   will   be   written   up   in   the   format   of   a   research   paper   which   will   contribute 60%   of   the   mark   for   the   module.
The   format   adopted   is   that   of   Scientific   Reports. It   publishes a   wide   variety   of   work   across   the   range   of   Biosciences so   you   should   be   able   to   find   an   example   paper   in   the same   broad   area   as   your   project   to   use   as   guidance.   You   may   also   find   it   helpful to   look at   papers from   other   journals   that   have   used   similar   techniques and   analyses.
Please   note   that   you   are NOT required   to   format   the   paper   to   look   like   a   published   paper in   Scientific   Reports   but   you   should   adhere   to   the   guidelines   below.   Please   use   a minimum   size   font   of   Arial   11pt.
The   following   are   taken   from   the   Scientific   Reports   instructions to   authors
https://www.nature.com/srep/publish/guidelines 
The   main   text   should   be   no   more   than 6,000 words EXCLUDING   Abstract,   References, Supplementary Information   and   figure   legends, and   should   contain   up   to   8   figures   (which   can be   composite)   and/or   tables.   Supplementary   information   files   are   optional.
Introduction   (~1000 words)
Articulates the   problem and   provides   essential   background   to   the   research   described. Cites   appropriate   and   recent   primary   literature.
Methods (~1000-1500   words).
All   the   methods used   in   the   paper   are   described   in   sufficient   detail   to   allow   replication.   Methods are   written   in   a   suitable   journal   format   (not   like   a   lab   protocol).   Key   references   are   cited.
Results   (~2000-2500   words)
Clear   presentation   of   the   data.   Figures   and   tables   fully   described   and   interpreted   in   the text.   Conclusions   (even if   negative)   fully   supported   by   the   data.   Where   appropriate suitable   quantitative   analysis   has   been   carried   out.   Replication   has   been   mentioned.   Appropriate   controls   have   been   used.
Figures   and   their   legends

Do   the   figure   legends   fully   and   accurately   describe   the   figures   and   do   the figure   and   legend   make   sense   without   the   text?   Are   the   figures   publication   quality   or   close   to   it   (even   if   the   results are   not)?
Discussion   (~1000-1500   words)
Where   results are   unexpected   or   negative   some   analysis   of   where   things   have   gone   wrong can   be   included   but   the   discussion   should   also   bring   in   a   critical   analysis   of   the   relevant literature   and   whether   the   results agree   or   disagree   with   published   work.   Any   novel findings should   be   highlighted.   Where   results are   preliminary   this should   be   discussed, and   it   should   be   permissible   to   propose   how   the   work   could   be   further   developed.   With   the   supervisor's agreement   results and   discussion   can be   combined.
Presentation   (including   abstract   and   referencing)
Abstract   (max 200   words)   should   serve   as   a   general   introduction   to   the   topic   and   a   brief non-technical   summary   of   the   main   results   and   their   implications.   References (Scientific Reports   suggest   as   a   guideline   up   to   60).   For this piece of work please use the Leeds Harvard reference format. Endnote   or   other   referencing   software   should   be   used.   References should   be   complete,   accurate,   appropriate,   and   correctly   formatted. Paper   should   be   well   structured   and   clearly   written.
Optional   Supplementary   data
Can include   useful   information   such   as   restriction   maps or   diagrams   of   constructs, raw data   sets,   code   etc   as   advised   by   the   supervisor.   Allow   the   student   to   present   information   that   are   relevant   but   a   distraction   from   the   narrative   of   the   paper   or   any   further   information   required   to   fully   reproduce   the   results.
Mark Scheme used will be the Level 5 marking scheme for research project dissertations.
